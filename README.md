# markdown-composer
Composes Markdown file trees into a singular Markdown file.

## Elevator Speech
Wanna write a larger project in Markdown?
Wanna have Git integration capabilities?
Wanna use a Scrivener-like project structure?

Markdown Composer is the thing for you! Just write in Markdown using your editor of choice, then run Markdown Composer on the project's root directory.
You'll have a single complete Markdown file which you can then transform however you like with Pandoc.

## Motivation
So I'm a software dev. I'm rather scatterbrained and need help keeping my s--t in order. I'm also a hobbyist sci-fi writer too.
Scrivener is the bee's knees - stellar for composing a complete manuscript, but it's a bit of a hassle to integrate with Git and I just don't enjoy writing in it.
Visual Studio Code is awesome, I love writing Markdown in that and there are extensions for natural language grammar checking. But if I want to write with a Scrivener-like project structure then there's going to be some tediousness in putting together all those markdown files into one nice manuscript.
